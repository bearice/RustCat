# 🐈‍⬛ RustCat

Your CPU’s new emotional support animal. Forget blinking graphs and sterile charts. RustCat is here to make your system monitoring adorable.

## 🚀 What is it?
RustCat is a lightweight, cross-platform taskbar companion that turns your CPU activity into a running cat animation. The faster the cat, the busier your CPU — no extra runtimes, no bloated dependencies, just pixel-perfect feline feedback.
